Hello

I'm Nikat

What do you want?

May be smth like code?

# Introdution
Here it is university programs from first and second year of studing.

# Making
Unpack code, open terminal in this folger and use this comand:
 * `make`
 
 
# AfterInfo
When you are codding,you should use [Makefile](https://www.csestack.org/makefile-tutorial-explained-example-beginners/).

Why?

Because it's too easy for recompilating after some changes, very fast and simple in terminal... 

Of couse, that's more beautiful too.

It's realy simple, belive.
